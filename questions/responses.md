ENBD Niraj:

AI driven Software development - how can we create autonomous agents that can run on cloud to do certain tasks such as code migration etc automatically fix all the lint build erros and then push the code to github without any human interaction
[5:09 PM, 10/21/2025] ENBD Niraj: How to do Agent observability in Multi agent systems


ENBD Ibrahim Khan: 

1. what is difference between platform engineering team and Developer expeirence team. Are both same names ?
2. what metrics can be used to measure and improve the DevEx ( we have devex team, let's measure if its helping out or not)
[7:35 PM, 10/21/2025] ENBD Ibrahim Khan: New concepts of Agents 2.0 also called DeepAgents

What problem do deepagents solve ?
1. complex reasoning
2. multi agents collaboration
3. semantic memory

What are the failure points of Shallow agents ( old agents) that deep agents have solved ?
1. hallucinations
2. infinite loops
3. tool misuse


ENBD Himanshu Sharma: 

How does AWS see the intersection of DX, AI tooling, and automation shaping the software 2.0?

How is AI integrated into AWS CI/CD pipelines  for automated prod releases?

What are the best architectural patterns AWS recommends for integrating AI agents within cloud native microservice environments?

What are the typical challenges in managing state, orchestration, and inter-agent communication at scale?

What’s AWS’s approach toward explainability and auditability in AI generated code or pipelines?

ENBD Aditi Tiwari: 

How can we make security, compliance, infra, and test — all embedded in AI-driven DevOps agents?

Can we create an autonomous agent that monitors pipeline failures, diagnoses the issue, and suggests or applies fixes automatically.

Can we have something like Agent Mesh for managing multiple AI agents’ lifecycles, context, and state at scale?

Centralized logging, tracing, and performance dashboard for AI agents that helps engineers debug agent workflows.

*DevOps culture for SE’s*

- *Observability & Reliability* – How are SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets defined and tracked for your services?
- *Incident Management* – What’s your on-call process and how do you automate detection, alerting, and root-cause analysis?
- *Security & Compliance* – How is security integrated into your build pipeline (e.g., secret scanning, dependency checks, IAM policy automation)?
- *Automation & Standardization -* Which parts of the SDLC are standardized and automated across squads (e.g., CI/CD templates, infrastructure blueprints, policy-as-code), and how are deviations tracked?

*AgentCore Architecture*

- How do your AI and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Bedrock / Azure OpenAI Service) support multi-agent orchestration — including state management, cross-tool coordination, and observability at scale?
- What’s your recommended approach to enforce fine-grained security and policy control for tool or API invocation inside agent frameworks?
- How does your platform enable scalable agent memory — combining vector search, structured databases, and unstructured data (e.g., S3, Fabric Lakehouse)?
- What built-in or configurable mechanisms exist for PII redaction, content filtering, and audit logging in agent-driven workflows?
- What best practices or tooling do you provide for cost tracking, telemetry, and performance observability across multi-LLM or multi-agent pipelines?

*AI Driven Software Development.* 

- How can AI be embedded across the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)?
- What human-in-the-loop workflows and collaboration models are required?
- What cultural and skill shifts are needed to build an “AI-First Developer Experience”?

*Accelerator for DX*

- How does Amazon ensure fast, consistent local development and CI/CD feedback across thousands of engineers and services?
- What governance or automation does Amazon use to maintain consistency across shared libraries, SDKs, and design systems?
- How does Amazon balance developer autonomy with organizational standards to foster innovation without chaos?
- How does Amazon enable developers to provision complete environments (infrastructure + services) autonomously while staying compliant and secure?


ENBD Mohammed Ashfaq - 
1. How do self-service platforms and internal developer portals improve the experience of provisioning resources and deploying services?
2. What DevOps practices most reduce context switching and cognitive load for developers (e.g., infrastructure as code, automated testing, containerization)?
3. How can agent-based architectures simplify the developer's mental model when building distributed systems?
4. What debugging and observability tools are essential for developers working with autonomous agents to maintain a good troubleshooting experience?
5. How should agent APIs be designed to make integration intuitive for developers who are new to agent-based systems?
6. How can agent orchestration frameworks abstract complexity while still giving developers enough control and visibility?
7. How do AI code assistants (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) change the developer workflow, and what metrics indicate improved versus degraded developer experience?
8. How do AI-powered debugging and error resolution tools reduce context switching and time-to-resolution for developers?
9. Which developer experience improvements provide the highest ROI in terms of velocity and developer satisfaction - faster builds, better documentation, or improved tooling?
10. How can organizations build effective feedback loops to continuously identify and address DX pain points?

# Questions for AWS Developer Experience Sessions
## 23rd October 2025

### Session 1: DevOps Culture at Amazon (9:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
**Speakers:** Ali Maaz (Sr Manager, DevOps GTM), Ben Coburn (Principal NGDE GTM Specialist)

1. **Observability & Incident Management**: How does Amazon define and track SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets across services, and what's your approach to automating incident detection, alerting, and root-cause analysis?

2. **Security in CI/CD**: How is security integrated into your build pipelines—specifically around secret scanning, dependency checks, and IAM policy automation?

3. **Standardization vs. Autonomy**: How does Amazon balance developer autonomy with organizational standards across thousands of engineers? What parts of the SDLC are standardized (CI/CD templates, infrastructure blueprints, policy-as-code), and how do you track deviations?

4. **Environment Provisioning**: How do you enable developers to autonomously provision complete environments (infrastructure + services) while maintaining compliance and security controls?

5. **Fast Feedback Loops**: What practices ensure fast, consistent local development and CI/CD feedback across thousands of engineers and diverse services?

### Session 2: AgentCore (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
**Speaker:** Amanda Lester (Sr GenAI Specialist, GTM)

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: How do AWS platforms (e.g., Bedrock) support multi-agent orchestration at scale—including state management, cross-tool coordination, and inter-agent communication?

2. **Agent Mesh & Lifecycle Management**: Can AWS support an "Agent Mesh" pattern for managing multiple AI agents' lifecycles, context, and state at enterprise scale?

3. **Deep Agents vs. Shallow Agents**: What problem do DeepAgents (Agents 2.0) solve that traditional agents don't—specifically around complex reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, semantic memory, hallucinations, infinite loops, and tool misuse?

4. **Security & Policy Control**: What's the recommended approach to enforce fine-grained security and policy control for tool or API invocation inside agent frameworks?

5. **Scalable Agent Memory**: How does your platform enable scalable agent memory by combining vector search, structured databases, and unstructured data sources (S3, data lakes)?

6. **Compliance & Auditing**: What built-in mechanisms exist for PII redaction, content filtering, and audit logging in agent-driven workflows?

7. **Observability & Cost Tracking**: What best practices or tooling does AWS provide for centralized logging, tracing, performance dashboards, and cost tracking across multi-LLM or multi-agent pipelines?

### Session 3: Leveraging AI in the Software Development Lifecycle (11:15 AM - 12:15 PM)
**Speaker:** Emil Lerch (Principal Builder Exp GTM)

1. **AI Across the SDLC**: How can AI be embedded across the entire Software Development Lifecycle—from planning and coding to testing, deployment, and monitoring?

2. **Autonomous Code Management**: How can we create autonomous agents that run on cloud infrastructure to perform tasks like code migration, automatically fix lint/build errors, and push code to GitHub without human intervention?

3. **AI-Driven Pipeline Intelligence**: Can autonomous agents monitor pipeline failures, diagnose issues, and automatically suggest or apply fixes? What does this look like in practice?

4. **Security & Compliance Integration**: How can security, compliance, infrastructure validation, and testing be embedded directly into AI-driven DevOps agents?

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Models**: What human-in-the-loop workflows and collaboration models are required when adopting AI-driven development? Where should humans remain in control?

6. **Cultural Transformation**: What cultural and skill shifts are needed within engineering teams to successfully build an "AI-First Developer Experience"?

7. **Explainability & Auditability**: What's AWS's approach toward explainability and auditability in AI-generated code, infrastructure, or CI/CD pipelines?

8. **Architectural Patterns**: What are the best architectural patterns AWS recommends for integrating AI agents within cloud-native microservice environments?

9. **Developer Experience & AI Tooling Intersection**: How does AWS see the intersection of Developer Experience (DX), AI tooling, and automation shaping Software 2.0?

## 24th October 2025

### Executive Meeting with AWS Developer Experience (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
**Speaker:** Ali Maaz (Sr Manager, DevOps GTM)

1. **Platform Engineering vs. Developer Experience**: What is the difference between Platform Engineering teams and Developer Experience teams? Are they the same, or do they serve distinct purposes?

2. **Measuring Developer Experience**: What metrics can be used to effectively measure and improve Developer Experience? How do you validate that DevEx initiatives are delivering tangible value to engineering teams?

3. **Governance & Consistency**: What governance or automation mechanisms does Amazon use to maintain consistency across shared libraries, SDKs, and design systems while enabling teams to innovate?

4. **Accelerating Development at Scale**: How does Amazon ensure fast iteration cycles, standardization, and quality across thousands of developers without creating bottlenecks or sacrificing autonomy?

5. **AI + DevOps Vision**: Looking ahead, how do you envision AI transforming DevOps culture and Developer Experience over the next 2-3 years in enterprise organizations?
